Current Implementation for game party: 
User can invite only his firends to the game party.
Future work: User can choose to invite friends for private sessions or open the invitation to the public for more social interaction.
This can be achieved by providing settings that allow users to switch between modes depending on their preference for each game party.

Future Work on gameparty collection
Create a Cron job to move all records having game party status as 'over' and time since created greater than 1 month to a backup collection 'gamepartyover' for faster mongo read operations on 'getparty' collection 

When player is online but not in any game party, player status: "idle" else "in-game".

Create a user-login endpoint. This will update the status to "idle".
Whenver a user logs-in, broadcast a real time message to all his friends with his online status
